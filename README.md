## Optical Character Recognition

In this project diffent tools for processing and extracting text and data from different formats are tried. 

1) In the first section tesseract is used for OCR on images of documents. This has high practical relevance since lot of documents are nowadays simply transfered by taking photo and send them. The resulting text from tesseract can consequently be structured for further processing. 

2) In the second section OCR can be performed by using asprise receipt API (https://ocr.asprise.com/api). The result gets saved into a json file. This json file gets consequently parsed.

3) The third section is about making images or photos of documents more readable. This can be useful for better results at performing OCR.

4) In the fourth section pdfs are parsed into usable text and consequently saved into a new docx file (Word file).
